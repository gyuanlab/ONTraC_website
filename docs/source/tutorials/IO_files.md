# Input and output files description

## Input files

### meta data file

A example meta data file `stereo_input.csv` is provided in [Zenodo Dataset repository](https://zenodo.org/records/15571644/files/Stereo_seq_data.zip) under `preprocessing` directory.
The meta data file looks like the following:

| Cell_ID         | Sample   | Cell_Type | x       | y     | z     |
| --------------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| E12_E1S3_100034 | E12_E1S3 | Fibro     | 15940   | 18584 | 0.0   |
| E12_E1S3_100035 | E12_E1S3 | Fibro     | 15942   | 18623 | 0.0   |
| ...             | ...      | ...       | ...     | ...   | ...   |
| E16_E2S7_326412 | E16_E2S7 | Fibro     | 32990.5 | 14475 | 0.0   |

- Cell_ID

  The name of each cell. It should be Cell_ID for cell-level data and Spot_ID for low resolution data.
  Warning: Duplicated Cell_IDs within the same sample are not permitted. In the event of duplicated Cell_IDs across samples, the sample name will be prefixed to Cell_ID.

- Sample

  The name of sample which each cell belongs to.

- Cell_Type

  Cell type for each cell.
  This column is not required for low resolution data.

- x
  
  X coordinate for each cell.

- y
  
  Y coordinate for each cell.

- z (optional)

  Z coordinate for each cell.

## Output files

A example output is provided in [Zenodo Dataset repository](https://zenodo.org/records/15571644/files/Stereo_seq_data.zip) under `ONTraC_output` directory.
